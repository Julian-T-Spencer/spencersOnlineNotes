# Spencer's Online Notes

## Website Intentions:

My intentions for this website are simply to create a set of permenant notes that I can access, and easily modify, from anywhere.
I would like to emphasize that these notes are made primarily for me, so they may or may not be useful to others.

If possible, I would like to exercise my programming skills a little bit to make some interactive javascript elements as well.
Additionally, before each subject, I will include a description of prerequisite knowledge, of which may or may not be on this website.

### Physics:
