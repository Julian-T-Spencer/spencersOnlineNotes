My intentions in the creation of this website are twofold:
Firstly, I'd like to make a set of notes, for myself, that I can easily reference and update from any computer.
Secondly, I'd like to make supporting materials that will help people who wish to learn the included subjects.
For the first use case, I will try to focus my notes on the important parts of each subject, and for the second use case, I will try to write each subject as if I were talking to a friend.

Here are a list of the subjects I currently have planned to write about:

Math:
	- Algebra
	- Geometry
	- Trigonometry
	- Linear Algebra
	- Singlevariable Calculus
	- Multivariable Calculus
	- Vector Calculus
	- Complex Analysis
	
Physics:

Electrical Engineering:
	- Electronics for Inventors

Computer Science:
	- Functional Programming
	- Object Oriented Programming
	- Web Development
	
Literature:
