# Website Intentions

My intentions in the creation of this website are twofold:

1. **Personal Notes**: I'd like to make a set of notes for myself that I can easily reference and update from any computer.
2. **Supportive Notes**: I'd like to create supporting notes to help people who wish to learn the included subjects.

If possible, I would like to exercise my programming skills a little bit to make some interactive javascript elements as well.
Additionally, before each subject, I will include a description of prerequisite knowledge, of which may or may not be on this website.
