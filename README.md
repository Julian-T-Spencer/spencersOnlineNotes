# Spencer's Online Notes

## Website Intentions:

My intentions for this website are simply to create a set of permenant notes that I can reference, and easily modify, from anywhere.
The purpose is to provide myself with a reference as well as to force myself to re-study and refine my knowledge. If possible, I would like to include interactive visual elements in these notes as well, both to help with understanding the material and to practice programming.

I would like make the disclaimer that these notes are made primarily for me, and thus, in a way that makes the most sense to me. If these notes are gibberish to you, I apologize. On the other hand, if you find these notes helpful, I'm grateful! Regardless, they will be made for primarily myself for now.
